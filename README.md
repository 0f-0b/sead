# sead
 Decompilation of Nintendo's standard library present in NSMBU  

# Goal
 The original goal was to get a 1:1 decompilation of all sead classes/methods present in NSMBU. However, that is sadly impossible for many reasons including no access to the compiler version used in NSMBU.  
 While a 1:1 decompilation is impossible, the current goal is to create code with 1:1 functionality and no less efficiency than the original code.
